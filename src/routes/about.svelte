      When I think about the starting point of my fascination with technology and computers, I would
      have to dedicate that title to the time my mom brought up an early IBM. She taught me enough
      commands to explore the file system and, from that moment, I was hooked. As I grew up, I never
      lost that drive to solve technological problems, and I also developed a passion for helping
      others by offering applicable solutions to their tech-based issues. I carried these interests
      into my career, and I am now a dedicated and passionate full-stack developer.

      From front-end to data base, I am well-versed in bringing anyone’s tech or web design vision
      to life. Inspired by influential individuals in the technology community, such as George Hotz
      founder of <a href="http://comma.ai">Comma.ai</a>
      and even Quincy Larson the founder of
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a>, I am adamant about staying updated
      on today’s best practices, innovations, and trends in the industry. As someone who once
      aspired to become a teacher, I enjoy taking the time to fully and transparently explain my
      process, solutions, and outcomes to clients.

      In 2007, I graduated from the College of Charleston, where I earned a Bachelor of Science
      degree. As someone who enjoys a good adventure, I am open to remote jobs as well as
      opportunities to completely relocate if needed. As I am interested in and compassionate
      towards other cultures, I would consider it an honor to work in an area I’ve never lived in
      before.

      When I am away from the office, I enjoy kitesurfing, flying drones, and filming these
      adventures for my
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pacetanner/playlists">YouTube channel.</a>. Notably, I’m
      currently developing a platform called
      <a href="kitesurf.ninja"> KiteSurfing Ninja,</a>
      which will be a free tool to further connect the kitesurfing community. In my spare time, I can
      often be found furthering the growth of my small photography and drone videography business,
      <a href="https://airautonomo.com"> Airautonomo.</a> Even when I am not working, I am
      consistently researching the field to ensure I provide my clients and employers with the most
      current full-stack developer technology solutions.<br class="paragraph" />
